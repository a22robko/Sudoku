# 🧪 Playwright UI Testing – Sudoku Web App

This project demonstrates how to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing of a JavaScript-based Sudoku web application.  
The test script simulates a complete user journey:

- ❌ Register with invalid input  
- 🔐 Log in  
- 🎮 Play Sudoku  
- ✅ Show correct solution  
- 🚪 Log out  

---

### ✅ Test View in Visual Studio Code

The test is executed via the **Test Explorer** in VS Code and shows as passed (green).  
The test name is:  
`Register (invalid), log in, play Sudoku, show solution, log out`.
